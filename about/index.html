  <h1>About This Site</h1>
  <p>This site was built with 11ty!</p>
  <p>
    My goal here is to create a place where I can shout into the void for
    personal and professional audiences
  </p>
  <p>
    My design choice for this site is a confusing blend between [This is a
    motherfucking website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) and some
    maximalist neocities wet dream.

    <br>With that in mind I'm starting every page with pure HTML + CSS and going from there!
    <br>Some inspirations for the design so far are: 
    <ul>
        <li>[Cabbage Sorter](https://cabbagesorter.neocities.org/) for the aesthetics!</li>
        <li>[James Vaughan](https://jamesbvaughan.com/) for the tight control and keeping things minimal while not giving <strong>only</strong> HTML and CSS.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Professionally I am a fullstack developer</p>
  <p>I started college very interested in Physics and Math.
  <br>I faced a lot of financial stress during this time and I wasn't a good student. I unfortunately had to drop out and try again with a new degree, Computer Science.
  <p>
    I toyed with programs ever since I was little but I started writing meaningful software in college around 2019. From there grew a love of computer science.

    <br>I graduated into a difficult market around for new hires in 2023 but managed to hold on to a local tech startup for nearly two years. 

    <br>I then took a crack at being a freelance contractor. I am currently doing this and staying way too busy for my own good doing it.
    
    <br>I would like more excuses to do mathematical or scientific work. If you have something like this for me please feel free to reach out!
  </p>
  <p>Some things I'd like to do if I had more free time:
  <ul>
    <li>Travel</li>
    <li>Get Better at Guitar</li>
    <li>Become a decent handyman</li>
    <li>Mend and make clothes</li>
    <li>Make electronics, get better at soldering</li>
    <li>Make a game with WebGL</li>
    <li>Fill out the rest of this list</li>
  </ul>
