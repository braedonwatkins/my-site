    I'm doing a <strong>lot</strong> of contract work! I'm very busy these days
    but I expect things to die down around 9/25. A lot of this work is
    full-stack software engineering in TS and Python.

    These days if I get free time I've been working on reinforcing my math /
    physics foundations. I'm currently reading LADR (Linear Algebra Done Right)!
    I am very rusty and being proficient in math makes me happy :)
